# Create a vCard
With this little piece of software you can create a qr code containing a vcard. You can then use this image to quickly share details like your phone number, email or address. <br>
The reason I created this is to do a little bit of testing with github actions. I might expand it in the future.

## How to run
Either clone the repo, go to the `src`folder and run `main.py` or head over to the [releases](https://github.com/gn0rrbitberrenbur/createVCard/releases) and download the latest one.
